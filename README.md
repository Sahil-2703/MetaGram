## Description
It's a MERN Stack Project, made by MongoDB, Express Js, React Js, Node Js. 
It's a socialmedia website where you can connect with more than millions of people and share you memories with them.

## Setup 
I've used VS code for making this project and used a react version of 18. There are lots of libraries used in this project. The best part of this project is that user's personal detail is secure even in the database. MongoDB is used for database, express js , an framework of node js is used for backend and react js is used in backend.

## Get Started
To start this project, first in terminal, make sure that you are in socialmedia directory then type 
'''
  npm start
'''
 After this, open another terminal and go to server folder. 
 '''
  type:-
   nodemon index.js
 '''
 Make sure your mongodb compass is open and have a database of name " SocialMedia ".
 Before running nodemon index.js, discomment the line 75 and 76 in server/index.js , and after running nodemon command again comment out this line.
 
 Now you are ready with the project.
